                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Jackson Kordon. I was born on June 6th, 2002. My place of origin is a town just north of Baltimore City called Towson. 
                    I spent most of my life there. Towson is where I grew up for most of my life and where I decided to start to get a career into art. 
                    I started drawing in 6th grade as a way to kill time, but it transformed into a jumping-off point for a prospective career. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started my interest in film when I was in 7th grade. My mom was a freelance art director for advertising agencies. She would
                    logos, designs, and from time-to-time, websites. But she wouldn't just design stuff, she would also work on sets for commercials
                    as an Art Director. There, she would get props, wardrobe, and the set itself. I told her I was interested in film, so she took me
                    on a few sets as a Production Assistant and showed me the ropes. My favorite ones she took me to was probably the two commercials 
                    for AARP. It was the first time anyone talked to me professionally, and I loved it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I continued this interest in highschool. There's a magnet school by my home that focuses on the arts, so I decided to apply to the
                    visual arts program, seeing as it has a film major. At the school, I studied filmmaking, continued my drawing, and started painting.
                    In my senior year, I decided to start experimenting with spray paint and steciling. It's a form of painting that I wanted to try for 
                    years, but never had the resources and time to actually do it for an assignment.
                </p>
                    As of now, I'm studying at Cleveland Institute of Art to get my BFA in film/photograpgy. My goal for my future career is to work in 
                    the film industry. Here, I'll also be focusing on doing some digital and possibly continuing my spray paint work in the future.
                <p>
